<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have worked for most of my life in the animal care industry. I spent 25 years working as a dog groomer.
  During that time I grew my own business, in 2017 i started teaching city and guilds level 2 and level 3 in Dog grooming 
  at Duchy College. 
</p>

<p>In 2014 I was involved in a car accident which resulted in me being hospitalised and took time for me to recover.
  in 2023 I decided that due to my injury I could no longer continue grooming or teaching, both jobs I loved, but my health 
  was more important. During the last 12 months I was determined to get back to work. Web development caught my eye, and simce
  then I have worked hard to acquire the neccesary skills to become a junior developer.
