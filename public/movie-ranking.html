<h1>The best movies according to Sarah</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h2>Dances with wolves</h2>

<p> I just love this movie, it is showcases how native americans where treated as second class citizens in the earlier 1900s</p>

<h2>Twisters</h2>

<p>I was surprised at how much i enjoyed this film. Although there were a few nods to its predecessor, it was an entirely separate movie in its own right. </p>

<h2>The Santa Clause</h2>

<p> Although this movie may not be everyones cup of tea. it brings back happy memories from my childhood, during my late fathers favourite time of year</p>
